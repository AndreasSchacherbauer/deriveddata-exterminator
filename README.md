# EXTERMINATE!

Sometimes Xcode needs a friendly helping hand with cleaning out the Derived Data for a project. The Exterminator makes this quick and easy.

### Replace This:

*Me:* Build Project
*Xcode:* Nope, we've got errors.
*Me:* Clean Project, then Build
*Xcode:* Nuh uh, still no good.
*Me:* _delete DerivedData for project_
*Xcode:* Oh hey, things are looking good.

### With This:

### Or This, if you use [MiniXcode](https://github.com/omz/MiniXcode):

## Installation

- Clone and build the project. The plugin will be installed into `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. (To uninstall the plugin, delete the `DerivedData-Exterminator` directory from there)
- Restart Xcode
- Select `Derived Data Exterminator in Title Bar` in the `View` menu

## Usage

- Push Button
- Get back to building cool stuff
- Moonwalk (optional, but recommended)
